# FDF Project

The "FDF" project is an implementation of a wireframe renderer for three-dimensional maps.
This project is designed to read a map file containing altitude data and display it as a wireframe using simple graphical libraries such as minilibx.

The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing representation of the map.
The project provides a hands-on experience with graphics programming and three-dimensional transformations.

## Features
- Wireframe rendering of three-dimensional maps.
- Interactive controls for rotation, zoom, and translation.
- Support for various map files.
